  abstract  = {Transformer-based language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are now mainstream in the NLP field, but extensions to languages other than English, to new domains and/or to more specific text genres are still in demand. In this paper we introduced BERTabaporu, a BERT language model that has been pre-trained on Twitter data in the Brazilian Portuguese language. The model is shown to outperform the best-known general-purpose model for this language in three Twitter-related NLP tasks, making a potentially useful resource for Portuguese NLP in general.}

    abstract = "Over the past years, the amount of online offensive speech has been growing steadily. To successfully cope with it, machine learning are applied. However, ML-based techniques require sufficiently large annotated datasets. In the last years, different datasets were published, mainly for English. In this paper, we present a new dataset for Portuguese, which has not been in focus so far. The dataset is composed of 5,668 tweets. For its annotation, we defined two different schemes used by annotators with different levels of expertise. Firstly, non-experts annotated the tweets with binary labels ({`}hate{'} vs. {`}no-hate{'}). Secondly, expert annotators classified the tweets following a fine-grained hierarchical multiple label scheme with 81 hate speech categories in total. The inter-annotator agreement varied from category to category, which reflects the insight that some types of hate speech are more subtle than others and that their detection depends on personal perception. This hierarchical annotation scheme is the main contribution of the presented work, as it facilitates the identification of different types of hate speech and their intersections. To demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset, we carried a baseline classification experiment with pre-trained word embeddings and LSTM on the binary classified data, with a state-of-the-art outcome.",

The HateBR corpus was collected from the comment section of Brazilian politicians{'} accounts on Instagram and manually annotated by specialists, reaching a high inter-annotator agreement. The corpus consists of 7,000 documents annotated according to three different layers: a binary classification (offensive versus non-offensive comments), offensiveness-level classification (highly, moderately, and slightly offensive), and nine hate speech groups (xenophobia, racism, homophobia, sexism, religious intolerance, partyism, apology for the dictatorship, antisemitism, and fatphobia). We also implemented baseline experiments for offensive language and hate speech detection and compared them with a literature baseline. Results show that the baseline experiments on our corpus outperform the current state-of-the-art for the Portuguese language.",

abstract = {An integrated deep learning paradigm for the analysis of document-based sentiments is presented in this article. Generally, sentiment analysis has enormous applications in the real world, particularly in e-commerce and/or cloud computing-oriented businesses. Integrated deep learning paradigms for document-based sentiment analysis seek to efficiently categorize the polarity of contextual sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral to aid organizations in making informed decisions. Nonetheless, the sparsity of text and disambiguation of natural languages make it relatively difficult for existing methods to provide precise identification and extraction when subjected to document-based data. As a result, this study introduces BERT-MultiLayered Convolutional Neural Network (B-MLCNN) as a computationally viable integrated deep learning paradigm. The B-MLCNN considers the overall textual review as a single document and classifies the available sentiments. First, the BERT pre-trained language model handles the feature vector representation and captures any global features. Further, the multi-layered convolutional neural network (MLCNN) with different kernel dimensions handles feature extraction. A softmax function produces classification results. The experimental setup with B-MLCNN based on IMDB movie reviews, 2002 movie reviews, 2004 movie reviews, and Amazon review datasets achieved accuracies of 95%, 88%, 95%, and 95% respectively, which promises to be efficient to deploy in practical applications.}
